I need to develop a comprehensive strategy that modernizes our operations while leveraging our strengths in personalized service and expertise. I have access to point-of-sale data but it hasn't been analyzed strategically before. I need to understand which departments are profitable, how to adjust our inventory mix, whether to invest in e-commerce, and how to attract younger customers without alienating our base."

Medical terminology needs to be accurate but accessible to health workers with varying levels of formal education. Cultural concepts of health, body, and illness differ significantly between regions, and visual representations need to be culturally appropriate while remaining medically accurate."
